Call-Remainder-App is an Android application that reminds users to call someone by triggering an alarm or notification when a call is detected. It is useful for setting reminders for any type of call, ensuring you never forget important conversations. Once a call event is detected, the app automatically activates and sets the reminder. To use the app effectively, all necessary permissions must be granted during setup.
